# Catherine's Professional Portfolio

## Description

This project is the beginings of my personal and professional portfolio. I enjoyed this project however it showed me how much of a way to go I have left.
-there are many placeholders in the HMTL due to the fact of uncertainty. This will be corrected once I get feedback and meet again with my tutor to turn this assignment in again. (go easy on me).
I learned how to trouble shoot most of my coding "walls" and did my best to be resourceful.

## Credits

usplash was used to supply imagry for the background and the css links either go to google or my personal LinkedIn account.
